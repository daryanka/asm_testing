# Disassembler Project

![](./media/demo.gif)

## Description

This is a simple learning project to help me understand rust a bit better.

It uses iced_x86 to disassemble a binary file and print the output to the console, and also to view the raw bytes.

This only works for windows binaries, PE files, and also displays some of the basic header information.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have rust and cargo installed
1. clone the repo
1. `cargo run -r <binary file>`
